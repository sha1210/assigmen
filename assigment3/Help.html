                            <p>To drive two-wheeler or four-wheeler legally on the roads, an Indian driving licence is mandatory. However, a permanent driving license cannot be received right away. There is a separate process for it.</p>
<p>An individual who wants to drive any type of motor vehicle in India has to get his/her learner's license first. A learner’s license is issued for learning. After a month of the issued learner’s license, the person has to appear for the test in front of an RTO authority, who upon proper examination, will declare if he/she has passed the exam or not.</p>

<p>A driving licence is basically an official document issued by the Government of India, permitting individuals to operate or drive a motorised vehicle such as a car, motorbike, truck, bus, etc., on a public road, without any supervision. In India, a driving licence is issued by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) or Regional Transport Office (RTO) of that particular state. The Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 states that no individual without the Driving licence is authorized to drive a motor vehicle in a public place.</p>
<p>Hence, if you wish to drive a motor vehicle like car or scooter on roads, you must first hold a valid driving licence in India. If you are practising to drive a vehicle, you must first get a Learners licence which will act as a provisional licence and then must take a test to qualify for getting a Driving licence. With the advent of online facilities that allow users to apply for a Driving licence from the comfort of their homes, getting a driving licence has become an easy task.</p>
<h2>Types of DL in India</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of vehicle a person uses, he or she can get a license for it. However, the eligibility requirements for every vehicle type will vary. The list of categories for which the driving license can be applied for are as follows:</p>

<h2>Test Procedure for Driving licence in India</h2>

Also, the Motor Vehicle Inspector will check if you are using indicators and relevant hand signals while driving. You will have to trace the shape of number 8 in your vehicle without your legs touching the ground.</li>
   <li>For a four wheeler driving licence, the Motor Vehicle Inspector will ask you to ride the car in a track and will note your skills. You must show proper hand signals, use the indicator and apply brakes wherever necessary. Also, shift the gears smoothly and use side &amp; rear view mirrors while driving.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How long does it take to get the Driving Licence after passing the test?</h2>
